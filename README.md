# Bootiful Azure 


* welcome folks thanks for coming sit down lets get to it 
* we don't have a ton of time 
* I wish we did to ponder this that and everything but we simply dont
* 20 minutes isnt enough time to make a baked Alaska (or some other famously quick thing - todo google food recipes)
* but it IS enough time to introduce the Spring and Azure technologies and the opportunities that they provide us and see those technologies deployed to production (something like that) 
* SQL server is one of the most powerful databases in the world; tons of features and -best of all - Microsoft will run it for you 
* support s reactive variant as well 
* now of course you could run your own SQ server the Real power comes in something like cosmosdb 
* bytes are data too! Azure objet storage is awesome 
* and of course sometimes I wanna tell other folks in the system about my data. This is what messaging is for. Martin fowler wrote a nice blog introducing four types of messaging 
* and now that weve got a singing dancing Spring app in less than 160 lines of code, lets get this thing to production! 
* Azure portal and go!
