# Bootiful Azure 

Join me, Spring Developer Advocate [Josh Long (@starbuxman)](http://twitter.com/starbuxman), for this packed look at taking your applications to productions with ease. In this talk we'll look at some of the amazing opportunities that await Spring and Microsoft Azure users. We'll begin our journey by looking at Azure Spring Cloud, the platform-as-a-service offering jointly developed and delivered by Microsoft and VMWare and built upon Azure Kubernetes. If you were looking for an easy, turn-key mechanism to get Spring-based applications up-and-running on Azure, then this the way to go. Then, we'll introduce Spring Cloud for Azure, the Spring Boot- and Spring Cloud-ready integrations and APIs that make connecting your applications with Azure-managed infrastructure an absolute breeze.
